# PalindromeCheck
Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a simple program that checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word, number, or phrase that reads the same forward and backward.

Use Case

This project can be used in:
Learning basic string manipulation
Understanding loops and conditional statements
Practicing logic building in programming
Checking palindromes in user input
Academic mini-project demonstrations

Project Flow

Start the program.
Accept input from the user (string or number).
Store the input in a variable.
Reverse the input using:
Loop method / Built-in function
Compare the original input with the reversed value.
If both are equal:
Display: "It is a Palindrome"
Else:
Display: "It is not a Palindrome"
End the program.
